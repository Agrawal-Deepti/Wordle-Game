Assignment 2 - Wordle game created by Deepti Agrawal
Design a program that would allow a user to enter their word as an input, and then indicate whether the letters matched
with the expected word (assume we have a single hidden word "SONAR" defined in the program).
Pseudocode
Set hidden_word
set guessed_words to empty
set is_word_matched to false
set is_char_matched to _ at all index
set attempts_allowed to 6
set trial counter to 0
While loop until is_word_matched iss true or trial >= 6
    Ask user to guess input and convert it to upper guess for easy comparison  and store in guessed_word
    If guessed_word length not matching with hidden_word
        then inform user,  Ignore guess attempt and continue loop
    If guessed_word contains digit
        then inform user, Ignore guess attempt and continue loop
    If guessed_word contains special character
        then inform user,  Ignore guess attempt and continue loop
    If guessed_word is previously guessed_words
        then inform user,  Ignore guess attempt and continue loop
    Keep track of guessed words for next attempt in guessed_words
    For loop on guessed_wordâ€™s each char to determine letter is in the correct spot, incorrect spot, or not in any spot
        If guessed_word[loop counter] is same as hidden_word[loop counter]
            then char is at correct spot so preserve that char at same spot of is_char_matched to show it to user
        If guessed_word[loop counter]  found in hidden_word
            then char is guessed correct but at incorrect spot, preserve with * in is_char_matched to show it to user
        If guessed_word[loop counter]  not found in hidden_word
            then char is not guessed correct, indicate that with _ in is_char_matched to show it to user
    Increase trial attempt
    If hidden_word is same as guessed_word
        then break the while loop
    If all 6 attempts are utilized
        then break the while loop
    Inform user what all chars of guessed_word are at correct spot, incorrect spot, or not in any spot
Finally inform user if word matched or did not match
